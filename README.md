        | Explicit                              | Implicit    |
        | --------------------------            |--------------------------|
        | You control the entire animation      | Flutter controls the animation |
        | More control but also more complexity | Less control and therefore less complexity |
        | Can often be avoided (by using pre-built Widgets) | Use pre-built animation widgets as often as possible      |
